### Introduction

This is a front-end focused code evaluation. You will have 3 hours to work on this followed by a 1 hour code review/walkthrough of what you have built.

You are not expected to finish everything. Work with whatever tools and frameworks you would like, though a React base is preferred.

### Story
We have a collection of succulents, with different details about each variety. We want to give our users a way to browse these succulents and view details about them as desired.

##### Requirements
- A user can view all succulents in the collection at once
- A user can view details on a specific succulent
- A user can filter the list of succulents by name (text search)
- A user can filter the list of succulents by category
- A user can "like" (and subsequently revoke the like) for any number of succulents

### Get started
The app is bootstrapped using `create-react-app`. You can start the development server via `yarn start` or `npm start`. For more information on `create-react-app`, see the `CRA-README.md` file.

`App.js` is your main entry point to the application.

### Where to get the data 
In this repo is a `json` file with an array of succulent data. You can consume it however you would like. Feel free to move it.

### Tests
Tests are always welcome and at least one test as a proof of concept would be ideal.
